### 🗓️ Log Entry: 2026-01-02 10:00:00 [Session 1/32]

**Strategic Focus**: `PE File Header Forensics: Import Tables & Entropy Analysis`

**Tactical Analysis (Atharv Mastermind Reflection)**:
- *Hypothesis*: Approached the problem under the assumption that system state would maintain deterministic boundaries under stress.
- *Observation*: Monitored telemetry during controlled execution. Edge conditions produce subtle timing and state shifts.
- *Breakthrough*: Isolated the core invariant violation. The vulnerability is verified without speculative assumptions.
