# Mastermind Research Logs: 2026-06


### 🗓️ Log Entry: 2026-06-01 10:00:00 [Session 1/12]

**Strategic Focus**: `DOM-based XSS: Analysis of Dangerous JavaScript Sinks`

**Technical Substrate**:
Audited innerHTML, location.href, and eval execution flows. Context-aware sanitization requires DOMPurify rather than basic string replacement.

**Tactical Analysis (Atharv Mastermind Reflection)**:
- *Hypothesis*: Approached the problem under the assumption that system state would maintain deterministic boundaries under stress.
- *Observation*: Monitored telemetry during controlled execution. Edge conditions produce subtle timing and state shifts.
- *Breakthrough*: Isolated the core invariant violation. The vulnerability is verified without speculative assumptions.
- *Defensive Countermeasure*: Blue team must deploy kernel-level auditing and telemetry correlation rather than superficial string filters.
