# Mastermind Research Logs: 2026-05


### 🗓️ Log Entry: 2026-05-03 10:00:00 [Session 1/9]

**Strategic Focus**: `RSA Low Public Exponent & Coppersmith Attack Vectors`

**Technical Substrate**:
When public exponent e=3 and padding is omitted or flawed, polynomial root-finding over integers recovers plaintext in sub-second time.

**Tactical Analysis (Atharv Mastermind Reflection)**:
- *Hypothesis*: Approached the problem under the assumption that system state would maintain deterministic boundaries under stress.
- *Observation*: Monitored telemetry during controlled execution. Edge conditions produce subtle timing and state shifts.
- *Breakthrough*: Isolated the core invariant violation. The vulnerability is verified without speculative assumptions.
- *Defensive Countermeasure*: Blue team must deploy kernel-level auditing and telemetry correlation rather than superficial string filters.

**Strategic Focus**: `Certificate Transparency Logs for Subdomain Enumeration`

**Technical Substrate**:
CT logs are immutable and append-only. Automated crt.sh parsing revealed staging and internal admin gateways exposed before DNS indexing.

**Strategic Focus**: `Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) Lua Engine Deconstruction`

**Technical Substrate**:
Dissected how Nmap handles service detection probes. Custom Lua scripts can extract target banner metadata with minimal packet footprint.
